  * - Aspect-oriented programming

    //they must be in seperate object otherwise scalac will have problems to compile it

    //Let's create some type alias describing our domain
    //Thanks to that we can put our domain object inside Free Monad and take advantage of 'monadic composition'
    type FreeInteraction[A] = Free[Interaction, A]

    //instead of working on pure Interaction types, we want to lift them into monad.
    //This can be achieved using liftF function which simply puts some value into Suspend case class
    import cats.free.Free.liftF

    //thanks to liftF we can create some handy routines.
    //They are often called the DSL and can be used to create our programs

    //ok. We have DSL for creating program. Let's use it and write some hello world program.
    //It will ask for name, surname and will print welcome message.
    //Note that prog is type of FreeInteraction[Unit] (the alias we defined earlier)
    //The prog is only the description of our program. If you expand it you will
    //see that it is just a data structure, which can be freely interpreted. 
    //This is why Free Monad is called the Free 
    val prog: FreeInteraction[Unit] = for {
      first <- ask("What is your first name?")
      last <- ask("What is your last name?")
      _ <- tell(s"Hello $first $last!")
    } yield ()

    //Let's create some concrete interpretation of prog (data structure representing program).

    //First we need the NaturalTransformation which simply represents the function of type F[_] => G[_]
    //Note that Id has the shape op G[_] and is often chosen here
    import cats.{Id, ~>}
    import cats.syntax.all

    //This is the one possible interpreter of programs
    object ConsoleInterpreter extends (Interaction ~> Id) {
      //Above line can be written as well as
      //object ConsoleInterpreter extends NaturalTransformation[Interaction, Id]

      //It has only one method, which tells what to do (how to handle) the Interaction instance:
      override def apply[A](fa: Interaction[A]): Id[A] = fa match {
        case Ask(s) => println(s); scala.io.StdIn.readLine()
        case Tell(m) => println(m);
      }
    }

    //And this is how you can run the program. Just call foldMap and pass the interpreter
//    prog.foldMap(ConsoleInterpreter)

    
    //It is possible to create many other interpreters, depending on what you want to achieve
    //People say, that FreeMonad allows you write aspect oriented programs.
    //This is the aspect of testing, where you create interpeter which will just record the outputs so you can
    //compare it later in assertions with expected values
    
    //Tester is a helper alias representing Function from KevValue to Container of List, and returned value A
    //KV store represents the input which would be provided on given prompts (remember Ask(prompt: String)
    type Tester[A] = Map[String, String] => (List[String], A)

    //This is interpreter for testing

        case Tell(message) => m => (List(message), ()) // hmm  mmmm ???
      }
    }
    
    //The tricky part is that if you want to run this interpreter in foldMap function, there is a constraint on it.
    //The constraint says that Tester must be a Monad. This is why this implicit implementation must live here:
    implicit val testerMonad = new Monad[Tester] {
      override def flatMap[A, B](fa: Tester[A])(f: (A) => Tester[B]): Tester[B] = m => { //WTF ???
        val (o1, a) = fa(m)
        val (o2, b) = f(a)(m)

    }

    //WTF ???
//    implicit val recursiveTailRecMTester: RecursiveTailRecM[Tester] = RecursiveTailRecM.create[Tester]

    //And this is you you can run the prog using created Test interpreter
    //As you can see this interpreter given the program will produce the Tester function.
    //This function can be used to test behaviour of prog
    val tester: Tester[Unit] = prog.foldMap(Test)
